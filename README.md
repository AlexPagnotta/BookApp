# BookApp
> A cross platform app to organize your books library

BookApp is a cross platform app, to help you organize your books library, with BookApp you can search for specific books and add them to your library.

You can also create custom shelves, so you can organize your books in various lists, for example, "To Read", "Reading" or even a "Shopping List".

## How has been made? 

BookApp has been developed using React Native (Expo) and the main reason why I have developed the app is to learn and improve my knowledge of React Native and React in general.

The BackEnd for the app has been also developed by me, using AspNet Core, you can check it out the project on Azure DevOps here :

The Google Books Api is also used to gather info about the books.
